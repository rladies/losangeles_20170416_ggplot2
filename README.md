# ggplot2 April RLadies meetup

Data + Code for `ggplot2` workshop at the [RLadies L.A. Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-la/events/238699893/) @ UCLA on Sunday, April 16th 2017

## What is `ggplot2`?

* `ggplot2` is a data visualization package for R
* developed by [Hadley Wickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham)
* inspired by Leland Wilkinson's ["The Grammar of Graphics"](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448)

## Why `ggplot2`?

* `ggplot2` provides an organizing philosophy for building graphs – a structured approach to graphing
* “The emphasis in `ggplot2` is reducing the amount of thinking time by making it easier to go from the plot in your brain to the plot on the page.” (Wickham, 2012)

## How to use these files

* You can clone or download this repository by clicking on the green button above, "Clone or download." The code and files are in "ggplot2_Rladies"
* The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/rladies/losangeles_20170416_ggplot2/blob/master/ggplot2_Rladies/grammar%20of%20graphics.ipynb) (.ipynb extension) is a short tutorial and can be accessed online by clicking the link
* I recommend opening the [.r code](https://github.com/rladies/losangeles_20170416_ggplot2/blob/master/ggplot2_Rladies/grammar%2Bof%2Bgraphics.r) in RStudio and running the code while following along in the notebook
